In Norse mythology, Mist is a Valkyrie.

Mist appears in the Valkyrie list in the Poetic Edda poem Grímnismál and both of the Nafnaþulur Valkyrie lists. No further information is provided about her. Rudolf Simek says that her name, Mist, is likely related to Old Norse mistr, meaning "cloud, mist," and that this "reminds us of the way in which valkyries *can ride through the air and over water*"
