# Goal
OpenMist wants to be a simple, light GPX viewer without serverside dependencies. The main goal is to allow visualising paragliding flights.

# Usage
OpenMist currently supports only local GPX files

## Local files
simply drag and drop a local GPX file on the globe or use the file picker to choose a local file.

## Remote files
You can pass the url of a remote GPX as a query parameter. As a temporary workaround (see [#2](../../issues/2)) Open Mist will ask you to download the file to load it in the globe. Example: 
https://openmist.berna.io/?gpx=https://github.com/mbernasocchi/openmist/blob/398544228b8f700d0781cabae029a00a43a92b4f/resources/test/20240216.gpx

# Name
In Norse mythology, Mist is a Valkyrie.

Mist appears in the Valkyrie list in the Poetic Edda poem Grímnismál and both of the Nafnaþulur Valkyrie lists. No further information is provided about her. Rudolf Simek says that her name, Mist, is likely related to Old Norse mistr, meaning "cloud, mist," and that this "reminds us of the way in which valkyries *can ride through the air and over water*"
